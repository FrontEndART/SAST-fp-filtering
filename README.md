# FP Filtering

Repository to collect everyting related to FP filtering. The project is related to two tasks within WP3 in the Sec4AI4Sec project, Task 3.1 (miner tool) and Task 3.3 (filter model, to be added later)

## Miner

Repository mining toolkit, dataset curation.

### Goals

- Unifying, merging and cleaning existing datasets
- Extend the datasets using newly mined TPs and FPs

## Filter

ML-based methods for vulnerability assessment.

### Goals

- Exploring the state-of-the-art
- CodeBERT-based code context embedding
- LLM based (GPT) baseline 
- Stella-based prediction
